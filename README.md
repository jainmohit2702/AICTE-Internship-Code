# Predcitive Analysis of Stock Market Data
## Welcome
Investment Bankers, Chartered Accountants, Hedge Fund/Portfolio Managers, Forex Traders, and Commodities Analysts have historically been among the most coveted professions. However, in today's era of data analysis, it is essential to keep up with the rapidly evolving demands to ensure one's skills remain relevant.

Data Science has become an indispensable field, asserting its importance in every sphere of corporate life. The integration of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the financial world has unlocked massive potential, making the idea of these domains being separate seem outdated.

Data Science has been instrumental in providing powerful insights that were previously unknown, significantly increasing efficiency across the industry. From scalp traders to long-term debt investors, the ability to make accurate predictions, conduct unbiased analyses, and utilize tools that process millions of rows of data in seconds has transformed the financial industry in ways previously unimaginable.

This project is designed to test and enhance your knowledge by providing hands-on experience with real-world financial data science problems.
